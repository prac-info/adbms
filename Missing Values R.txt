#NA : Not Available - Known as missing values
#Works as a place holder for something that is ‘missing’
#Most basic operations(addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) 
#in R deal with it without crashing and return NA if one of the inputs is NA 
#is.na(VALUE) is used to check if the input value is NA or not.
#Returns a TRUE/FALSE vector Whereas in case of Excel like utilities for numeric computations it’s assumed to be 0
# Operation with NA
NA+4
# Create a vector V with 1 NA value
V <- c(1,2,NA,3)
V
# Median with NA 
median(V)
# median without NA (remove NA) 
median(V, na.rm = T) 
# Apply is.na() to vector 
is.na(V)
# Removing the NA values by using logical indexing 
naVals <- is.na(V)
# Get values that are not NA
V[!naVals]
# Replace NA values with 0
V[is.na(V)] <- 0 
print(V)
#The process of estimating or deriving missing values There are various methods for imputation
#–Imputation of the mean
#–Imputation of the median
#–Imputation using linear regression models
#Package Hmisc implments many imputation methods, few examples (Download package Hmisc)
install.packages("Hmisc")

## create a vector 
x = c(1,2,3,NA,4,4,NA)
x
# mean imputation - from package, mention name of function to be used 
x <- impute(x, fun = mean)
